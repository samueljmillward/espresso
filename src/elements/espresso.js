            Our house espresso is a modern take on a classic. It’s a blend of
            two distinctive coffees, which combine to produce an espresso with a
            deep, rich chocolatey body, pronounced toffee sweetness, a complex
            fruity edge, and a hint of bittersweet cocoa at the finish. It’s
            well balanced and combines beautifully with milk, where it adds
            punchy caramel, smooth milk chocolate notes and gets even sweeter
